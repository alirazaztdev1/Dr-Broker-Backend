# Dr-Broker-Backend

Dr-Broker-Backend is a backend server project that provides a comprehensive system for managing doctor-patient appointments, treatments, and medicine prescriptions. It serves as the server-side component for a healthcare application that facilitates seamless communication and coordination between doctors and patients.

## Features

### Doctor Management
- API endpoints for doctor registration and login
- User authentication and authorization for doctors
- Profile management for doctors
- Access to patient records and appointments

### Patient Management
- API endpoints for patient registration and login
- User authentication and authorization for patients
- Profile management for patients
- Booking and managing appointments with doctors

### Appointments
- API endpoints for creating, updating, and canceling appointments
- Scheduling and calendar integration for efficient appointment management
- Notifications and reminders for doctors and patients about upcoming appointments

### Treatment
- API endpoints for managing patient treatments
- Recording and tracking patient medical history
- Prescription management for doctors
- Integration with pharmacy systems for prescription fulfillment

### Medicine
- API endpoints for managing medicines and prescriptions
- Medication database integration for accurate information
- Prescription tracking and refill reminders for patients
- Integration with pharmacy systems for medication delivery

## Technologies Used

- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications
- Express.js: A flexible Node.js web application framework for building APIs
- MongoDB: A popular NoSQL database for storing user data and medical records
- JWT: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication and session management
- Calendar integration: Integration with calendar APIs for appointment scheduling
- Pharmacy system integration: Integration with pharmacy systems for prescription fulfillment and medication delivery

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB database

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ````shell
   git clone https://github.com/alirazaztdev1/Dr-Broker-Backend.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ````shell
   cd dr-broker-backend
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

   ````plaintext
   MONGODB_URI=your-mongodb-uri
   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```

   Replace `your-mongodb-uri` with your MongoDB connection URI and `your-jwt-secret` with a secure secret for JWT token generation.

4. Run the server:

   ````shell
   npm start
   ```

   The server will start running at the specified port (default: 3000).

## Usage

Once the server is up and running, you can interact with the API endpoints to manage doctor profiles, patient profiles, appointments, treatments, and medicines. The specific endpoints and usage will depend on the implementation details of your project.

You can integrate the backend with a frontend application or test the endpoints using API testing tools (e.g., Postman, curl).
