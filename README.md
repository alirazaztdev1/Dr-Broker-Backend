#### Introduction

# Backend Project Created Using Node.js with TypeScript, Express.js and MongoDB as Database Server

A few things to note in the project:
* **TypeScript** - It uses TypeScript.
* **JWT** - It uses JWT Token for Authentication.
* **Mongo Connection Helper** - A helper class to connect to MongoDB reliably.
* **Middleware for easier async/await** - Catches errors from routes and throws them to express error handler to prevent app crash due to uncaught errors.
* **.env file for configuration** - Change server config like app port, mongo url etc
* **Winston Logger** - Uses winston as the logger for the application.
